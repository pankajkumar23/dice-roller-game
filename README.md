# React + Vite dice-roller-game

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.
## About
This is an interactive dice game built with React.js, where players can test their luck and prediction skills. The game allows players to select a number and roll a virtual dice. If the selected number matches the number rolled on the dice, the player earns points equal to the dice number. However, if the guess is incorrect, 2 points are deducted. The game provides an engaging and simple experience, making use of React components and state management to dynamically update the score and game interactions
